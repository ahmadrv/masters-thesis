	abstract = {The technological development of increasingly larger quantum processors on different quantum platforms raises the problem of how to fairly compare their performance, known as quantum benchmarking of quantum processors. This is a challenge that computer scientists have already faced when comparing classical processors, leading to the development of various mathematical tools to address it, but also to the identification of the limits of this problem. In this work, we briefly review the most important aspects of both classical processor benchmarks and the metrics comprising them, providing precise definitions and analyzing the quality attributes that they should exhibit. Subsequently, we analyze the intrinsic properties that characterize the paradigm of quantum computing and hinder the naive transfer of strategies from classical benchmarking. However, we can still leverage some of the lessons learned such as the quality attributes of a {\textbackslash}textit\{good\} benchmark. Additionally, we review some of the most important metrics and benchmarks for quantum processors proposed in the literature, assessing what quality attributes they fulfill. Finally, we propose general guidelines for quantum benchmarking. These guidelines aim to pave the way for establishing a roadmap towards standardizing the performance evaluation of quantum devices, ultimately leading to the creation of an organization akin to the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC).},

Such simulations will always face limits preventing the emulation of quantum computers of substantial scale but by pushing the envelope as far as possible through optimal choices of algorithms and hardware the value of the simulator tool is maximized. This work reviews the state-of-the-art numerical simulation methods i.e. the classical algorithms that emulate quantum computer evolution under specific operations. We focus on the mainstream state-vector and tensor-network paradigms while briefly mentioning alternative methods. Moreover we review the diverse applications of simulation across different facets of quantum computer development such as understanding the fundamental difference between quantum and classical computations exploring algorithm design spaces for quantum advantage predicting quantum processor performance at the design stage and characterizing fabricated devices efficiently for fast iterations. This review complements recent surveys on today's tools and implementations here we seek to acquaint the reader with an essential understanding of the theoretical basis of classical simulations detailed discussions on the advantages and limitations of different methods and the demands and challenges arising from practical use cases.},

Then, we short-list the simulators that are actively maintained and enable simulation of quantum algorithms for more than 10 qubits. As a result, we realize that most efficient and actively maintained simulators have been developed after 2010. We also provide a taxonomy of the most important simulation methods, namely Schrodinger-based, Feynman path integrals, Heisenberg-based, and hybrid methods. We observe that most simulators fall in the category of Schrodinger-based approaches. However, there are a few efficient simulators belonging to other categories. We also make note that quantum frameworks form their own class of software tools that provide more flexibility for algorithm designers with a choice of simulators/simulation method. Another contribution of this study includes the use and classification of optimization methods used in a variety of simulators. We observe that some state-of-the-art simulators utilize a combination of software and hardware optimization techniques to scale up the simulation of quantum circuits. We summarize this study by providing a roadmap for future research that can further enhance the use of quantum simulators in education and research.},

This includes calculations that aim at probing regimes of quantum advantage, where a quantum computer outperforms a classical computer in the same task. High performance computing (HPC) platforms play a crucial role as today’s quantum devices already reach beyond the limits of what powerful workstations can model, but a systematic evaluation of the individual performance of the many offered simulation packages is lacking so far. In this Technical Review, we benchmark several software packages capable of simulating quantum dynamics with a special focus on HPC capabilities. We develop a containerized toolchain for benchmarking a large set of simulation packages on a local HPC cluster using different parallelisation capabilities, and compare the performance and system size-scaling for three paradigmatic quantum computing tasks. Our results can help finding the right package for a given simulation task and lay the foundation for a systematic community effort to benchmark and validate upcoming versions of existing and also newly developed simulation packages.},

In this work, we give an overview of both simulation methods (exact and approximate), highlighting the main physics-based and software-based techniques. Moreover, we run computationally heavy benchmarks on a single GPU, executing large quantum Fourier transform circuits and large random circuits. Compared with other classical simulators, we report competitive execution times for the exact simulation of Fourier transform circuits with up to 27 qubits. We also demonstrate the approximate simulation of all amplitudes of random circuits acting on 54 qubits with 7 layers at average fidelity higher than \$4{\textbackslash}\%\$, a task commonly considered hard without super-computing resources.},

	abstract = {The real-time simulation of large many-body quantum systems is a formidable task, that may only be achievable with a genuine quantum computational platform. Currently, quantum hardware with a number of qubits sufficient to make classical emulation challenging is available. This condition is necessary for the pursuit of a so-called quantum advantage, but it also makes verifying the results very difficult. In this manuscript, we flip the perspective and utilize known theoretical results about many-body quantum critical dynamics to benchmark quantum hardware and various error mitigation techniques on up to 133 qubits. In particular, we benchmark against known universal scaling laws in the Hamiltonian simulation of a time-dependent transverse field Ising Hamiltonian. Incorporating only basic error mitigation and suppression methods, our study shows coherent control up to a two-qubit gate depth of 28, featuring a maximum of 1396 two-qubit gates, before noise becomes prevalent. These results are transferable to applications such as digitized quantum annealing and match the results of a 133-site optimization, where we identify an optimal working point in terms of both circuit depth and time step.},

	abstract = {Most of the existing quantum neural network models, such as variational quantum circuits (VQCs), are limited in their ability to explore the non-linear relationships in input data. This gradually becomes the main obstacle for it to tackle realistic applications, such as natural language processing, medical image processing, and wireless communications. Recently, there have emerged research efforts that enable VQCs to perform non-linear operations. However, it is still unclear on the approximability of a given VQC (i.e., the order of non-linearity that can be handled by a specified design). In response to this issue, we developed an automated tool designed to benchmark the approximation of a given VQC. The proposed tool will generate a set of synthetic datasets with different orders of non-linearity and train the given VQC on these datasets to estimate their approximability. Our experiments benchmark VQCs with different designs, where we know their theoretic approximability. We then show that the proposed tool can precisely estimate the approximability, which is consistent with the theoretic value, indicating that the proposed tool can be used for benchmarking the approximability of a given quantum circuit for learning tasks.},

In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a low-level, easy-to-use benchmark suite called QASMBench based on the OpenQASM assembly representation. It consolidates commonly used quantum routines and kernels from a variety of domains including chemistry, simulation, linear algebra, searching, optimization, arithmetic, machine learning, fault tolerance, cryptography, etc., trading-off between generality and usability. To analyze these kernels in terms of NISQ device execution, in addition to circuit width and depth, we propose four circuit metrics including gate density, retention lifespan, measurement density, and entanglement variance, to extract more insights about the execution efficiency, the susceptibility to NISQ error, and the potential gain from machine-specific optimizations. Applications in QASMBench can be launched and verified on several NISQ platforms, including IBM-Q, Rigetti, IonQ and Quantinuum. For evaluation, we measure the execution fidelity of a subset of QASMBench applications on 12 IBM-Q machines through density matrix state tomography, which comprises 25K circuit evaluations. We also compare the fidelity of executions among the IBM-Q machines, the IonQ QPU and the Rigetti Aspen M-1 system. QASMBench is released at: http://github.com/pnnl/QASMBench.},

	abstract = {The anticipated applications of quantum computers span across science and industry, ranging from quantum chemistry and many-body physics to optimization, finance, and machine learning. Proposed quantum solutions in these areas typically combine multiple quantum algorithmic primitives into an overall quantum algorithm, which must then incorporate the methods of quantum error correction and fault tolerance to be implemented correctly on quantum hardware. As such, it can be difficult to assess how much a particular application benefits from quantum computing, as the various approaches are often sensitive to intricate technical details about the underlying primitives and their complexities. Here we present a survey of several potential application areas of quantum algorithms and their underlying algorithmic primitives, carefully considering technical caveats and subtleties. We outline the challenges and opportunities in each area in an "end-to-end" fashion by clearly defining the problem being solved alongside the input-output model, instantiating all "oracles," and spelling out all hidden costs. We also compare quantum solutions against state-of-the-art classical methods and complexity-theoretic limitations to evaluate possible quantum speedups. The survey is written in a modular, wiki-like fashion to facilitate navigation of the content. Each primitive and application area is discussed in a standalone section, with its own bibliography of references and embedded hyperlinks that direct to other relevant sections. This structure mirrors that of complex quantum algorithms that involve several layers of abstraction, and it enables rapid evaluation of how end-to-end complexities are impacted when subroutines are altered.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing systems need to be benchmarked in terms of practical tasks they would be expected to do. Here, we propose 3 "application-motivated" circuit classes for benchmarking: deep (relevant for state preparation in the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm), shallow (inspired by IQP-type circuits that might be useful for near-term quantum machine learning), and square (inspired by the quantum volume benchmark). We quantify the performance of a quantum computing system in running circuits from these classes using several figures of merit, all of which require exponential classical computing resources and a polynomial number of classical samples (bitstrings) from the system. We study how performance varies with the compilation strategy used and the device on which the circuit is run. Using systems made available by IBM Quantum, we examine their performance, showing that noise-aware compilation strategies may be beneficial, and that device connectivity and noise levels play a crucial role in the performance of the system according to our benchmarks.},

	abstract = {In the near-term "NISQ"-era of noisy, intermediate-scale, quantum hardware and beyond, reliably determining the quality of quantum devices becomes increasingly important: users need to be able to compare them with one another, and make an estimate whether they are capable of performing a given task ahead of time. In this work, we develop and release an advanced quantum benchmarking framework in order to help assess the state of the art of current quantum devices. Our testing framework measures the performance of universal quantum devices in a hardware-agnostic way, with metrics that are aimed to facilitate an intuitive understanding of which device is likely to outperform others on a given task. This is achieved through six structured tests that allow for an immediate, visual assessment of how devices compare. Each test is designed with scalability in mind, making this framework not only suitable for testing the performance of present-day quantum devices, but also of those released in the foreseeable future. The series of tests are motivated by real-life scenarios, and therefore emphasise the interplay between various relevant characteristics of quantum devices, such as qubit count, connectivity, and gate and measurement fidelity. We present the benchmark results of twenty-one different quantum devices from IBM, Rigetti and IonQ.},

However, since physical realizations of quantum computers are in their infancy, a signiﬁcant amount of research in this domain still relies on simulations of quantum computations on conventional machines. This causes a signiﬁcant complexity which current state-of-the-art simulators try to tackle with a rather straight forward array-based representation and by applying massive hardware power. There also exist solutions based on decision diagrams (i.e. graph-based approaches) that try to tackle the exponential complexity by exploiting redundancies in quantum states and operations. However, these existing approaches do not fully exploit redundancies that are actually present.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers promise signiﬁcant speedups in solving problems intractable for conventional computers but, despite recent progress, remain limited in scaling and availability. Therefore, quantum software and hardware development heavily rely on simulation that runs on conventional computers. Most such approaches perform strong simulation in that they explicitly compute amplitudes of quantum states. However, such information is not directly observable from a physical quantum computer because quantum measurements produce random samples from probability distributions deﬁned by those amplitudes. In this work, we focus on weak simulation that aims to produce outputs which are statistically indistinguishable from those of error-free quantum computers. We develop algorithms for weak simulation based on quantum state representation in terms of decision diagrams. We compare them to using state-vector arrays and binary search on preﬁx sums to perform sampling. Empirical validation shows, for the ﬁrst time, that this enables mimicking of physical quantum computers of signiﬁcant scale.},

	abstract = {As quantum computers improve in the number of qubits and fidelity, the question of when they surpass state-of-the-art classical computation for a well-defined computational task is attracting much attention. The leading candidate task for this milestone entails sampling from the output distribution defined by a random quantum circuit. We develop a massively-parallel simulation tool Rollright that does not require inter-process communication (IPC) or proprietary hardware. We also develop two ways to trade circuit fidelity for computational speedups, so as to match the fidelity of a given quantum computer --- a task previously thought impossible. We report massive speedups for the sampling task over prior software from Microsoft, IBM, Alibaba and Google, as well as supercomputer and GPU-based simulations. By using publicly available Google Cloud Computing, we price such simulations and enable comparisons by total cost across hardware platforms. We simulate approximate sampling from the output of a circuit with 7x8 qubits and depth 1+40+1 by producing one million bitstring probabilities with fidelity 0.5\%, at an estimated cost of \$35184. The simulation costs scale linearly with fidelity, and using this scaling we estimate that extending circuit depth to 1+48+1 increases costs to one million dollars. Scaling the simulation to 10M bitstring probabilities needed for sampling 1M bitstrings helps comparing simulation to quantum computers. We describe refinements in benchmarks that slow down leading simulators, halving the circuit depth that can be simulated within the same time.},
